HP = (Disp/1000) * [Kts / (Cw * HL^½)]^3

Cw = 0.8 + (0.17 * SL Ratio)

Hull speed (Kts) = SL Ratio * HL^½

SL Ratio = (Buttock Angle * -0.2) + 2.9

e.g. 
26’ boat with Buttock Angle = 2°

SL Ratio = (2 * -0.2) + 2.9 = 2.5

Hull Speed = 2.5 * √26  = 12.75 knots

Cw = 0.8 + (0.17 * 2.5) = 1.225

for 2000lb

HP for Hull Speed = 2 * (12.75/(1.225*√26))^3  = 17hp
HP for 5kts       = 2 * (5/(1.225*√26))^3      = 1.03hp
HP for 10kts      = 2 * (10/(1.225*√26))^3     = 8.21hp
HP for 15kts      = 2 * (15/(1.225*√26))^3     = 27.7hp

35' boat with Buttock Angle = 3°

SL Ratio = (3 * -0.2) + 2.9 = 2.3

Hull Speed = 2.3 * √35 = 13.6

Cw = 0.8 + (0.17 * 2.3) = 1.191

for 2000lb

HP for Hull Speed = 2 * (13.61/(1.191*√35))^3 = 14.4hp
HP for 5kts       = 2 * (5/(1.191*√35))^3    = 0.71hp
HP for 10kts      = 2 * (10/(1.191*√35))^3   = 5.72hp
HP for 15kts      = 2 * (15/(1.191*√35))^3   = 19.3hp
